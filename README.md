# A/B Test Analysis for the Mobile Game "Cookie Cats"
## 1.Project Overview & Business Problem
The developer of the mobile game "Cookie Cats" conducted an A/B test to evaluate how changing the position of a "gate" from level 30 to level 40 affects player retention. The goal of this analysis is to determine the test's outcome and provide a data-driven recommendation on whether to implement this change for all players.
## 2. Tech Stack
* ### Python
* ### Pandas
* ### SciPy
* ### Matplotlib / Seaborn
* ### Jupyter Notebook
## 3. Analysis Steps
### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Load the dataset and check for any inconsistencies or missing values.
### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform an initial investigation of the data to understand the distribution of players and their overall behavior.
### 3. **Hypothesis Formulation:** Define the Null (H₀) and Alternative (H₁) hypotheses for the A/B test.
### 4. **Metric Calculation:** Calculate 1-day and 7-day retention rates for both the control and test groups.
### 5. **Statistical Testing:** Conduct a Chi-squared test to determine if the observed difference is statistically significant.
### 6. **Result Visualization:** Create plots to visually compare the retention rates of the two groups.
